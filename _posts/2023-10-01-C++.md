[C++ template complete guide](http://ultra.sdk.free.fr/docs/DxO/C%2B%2B%20Templates%20The%20Complete%20Guide.pdf)

template template parameters:
The name of a template parameter of a template template parameter can be used only in the declaration of other
parameters of that template template parameter. The following contrived template illustrates this concept:

```c++
template <template<typename T, T*> class Buf>
class Lexer {
 static char storage[5];
 Buf<char, &Lexer<Buf>::storage> buf;
 …
}; // OK
template <template<typename T> class List>
class Node {
 static T* storage; // ERROR: a parameter of a template template
 // parameter cannot be used here
 …
};
```

qualified vs unqualified:

```c++
extern int count; // (1)
int lookup_example(int count) // (2)
{
  if (count < 0) {
    int count = 1; // (3)
    lookup_example(count); // unqualified count refers to (3)
  }
  return count + ::count; // the first (unqualified) count refers to (2);
} // the second (qualified) count refers to (1)
```

How to find the pos of an elem in a vector:

```c++
using namespace std;
vector<int> n = {1,2,3,4,5};
int e = 3;
int pos = find(begin(n), end(n), e) - begin(n);
```

# Effective C++

```c++
const char* const ptr = "abc";
```

First const: what `ptr` points to is const.
Second const: ptr can't be made to point to a different location, so `ptr` is const.

```c++
// return size of an array as a compile-time constant. (The
// array parameter has no name, because we care only about
// the number of elements it contains.)
//
// constexpr makes its result available during compilation.
// noexcept help compiler generate better code.
template<typename T, std::size_t N>
constexpr std::size_t arraySize(T (&)[N]) noexcept {
  return N;
}
```

## Item 2: UNderstand `auto` type deduction

### TLDR

- `auto` type deduction is usually the same as template type deduction, but `auto` type deduction assumes that a braced initializer represents a `std::initializer_list`, and template type deduction doesn’t.
- `auto` in a function return type or a lambda parameter implies template type deduction, not `auto` type deduction.

`auto` type deduction works like template type deduction.

array and function names decay into ptrs for non-ref type specifiers.

```c++
const char name[] = "R. N. Briggs";// name's type is const char[13]
auto arr1 = name;// arr1's type is const char*
auto& arr2 = name;// arr2's type is const char (&)[13]

void someFunc(int, double);// someFunc is a function; type is void(int, double)
auto func1 = someFunc;// func1's type is void (*)(int, double)
auto& func2 = someFunc;// func2's type is void (&)(int, double)
```

`auto` may differ from template:

```c++
auto x1 = 27;// type is int, value is 27
auto x2(27);// ditto
auto x3 = { 27 };// type is std::initializer_list<int>, value is { 27 }
auto x4{ 27 };// ditto
```

When an auto–declared variable is initialized with a
braced initializer, the deduced type is an instantiation of `std::initializer_list`.

a function with an `auto` return type that returns a braced initializer won’t compile(these uses of
`auto` employ template type deduction):

```c++
auto createInitList()
{
return { 1, 2, 3 };
}
// error: can't deduce type
// for { 1, 2, 3 }
```

## Item 3: Understand decltype

### TLDR

- `decltype` almost always yields the type of a variable or expression without any modifications.
- For lvalue expressions of type `T` other than names, decltype always reports a type of `T&``.
- C++14 supports `decltype(auto)`, which, like `auto`, deduces a type from its initializer, but it performs the type deduction using the `decltype` rules.

A trailing return type has the advantage that the function's params can be used in the specification of the return type.

```c++
template<typename Container, typename Index>
auto ABC(Container& c, Index i) -> decltype(c[i]) {
  return c[i];
}
```

```c++
decltype(auto) f1()
{
int x = 0;
…
return x;
// decltype(x) is int, so f1 returns int
}
decltype(auto) f2()
{
int x = 0;
…
return (x);
// decltype((x)) is int&, so f2 returns int&
}
```

## Item 6: Use the explicitly typed initializer idiom when auto deduces undesired types

#### TLDR

1. "Invisible" proxy types can cause `auto` to deduce the "wrong" type for an initializing expression.
2. The explicitly typed initializer idiom forces `auto` to deduce the type you want it to have.

```c++
std::vector<bool> f();
auto v = f()[1]; // v is not bool type
f2(v); // undefined behavior!
```

`v` has a type of `std::vector<bool>::reference`, because:

1. `operator[]` for `std::vector<T>` is supposed to return a `T&`.
2. C++ forbids references for bits.
3. The `std::vector<bool>::reference` it returns contains a pointer to a word in the data structure holding the bits, and it's managed by a temporary `std::vector<bool>` object. At the end, the temp object is destroyed, and `v` contains a dangling pointer.

```c++
bool v = f()[1];
```

Here `std::vector<bool>::reference` is implicitly converted to `bool`.
`std::vector<bool>::reference` is a <i>proxy class</i>. Smart pointer is also a proxy class.

Avoid `auto v = expression of "invisible" proxy class type;`

#### explicitly typed initializer idiom

```c++
auto v = static_cast<bool>(f()[1]);
```

This can also be useful to emphasize that you're deliberately creating a variable of a type that's different from the one generated by the initializing expression, which makes things transparent.

## Item 7: Distinguish between () and {} when creating objects

#### TLDR

1. Braced initialization is the most widely usable initialization syntax, it prevents narrowing conversions, and it’s immune to C++’s most vexing parse.
2. During constructor overload resolution, braced initializers are matched to `std::initializer_list` parameters if at all possible, even if other constructors offer seemingly better matches.
3. An example of where the choice between parentheses and braces can make a significant difference is creating a `std::vector<numeric type>` with two arguments.
4. Choosing between parentheses and braces for object creation inside templates can be challenging.

```c++
Widget w1; // call default constructor
Widget w2 = w1; // not an assignmentl; calls copy ctor
w1 = w2; // an assignment; calls copy operator=
```

C++11 introduces _uniform initialization_:

```c++
std::vector<int> v{1,3,5}; // v's initial content is 1,3,5
```

```c++
double x,y,z;
...
int sum1{x+y+z}; //err, sum of doubles may not be expressible as int
```

Cons:

- Confusion with `std::initializer_list`. Class's ctor with `std::initializer_list` as param is always used if invoked by `Class{...}`, even if it might be a worse match comparing with other ctors.

```c++
class Widget {
public:
Widget(int i, bool b);
Widget(int i, double d);

Widget(std::initializer_list<bool> il);
};
Widget w{10, 5.0}; // error! requires narrowing conversions
```

Templ implications:

```c++
template<typename T, // type of object to create
        typename... Ts> // types of arguments to use
void doSomeWork(Ts&&... params)
{
   create local T object from params...
  …
}
```

There are two ways to turn the line of pseudocode into real code:

```c++
T localObject(std::forward<Ts>(params)...);// using parens
T localObject{std::forward<Ts>(params)...};// using braces
```

Caller's code:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v;
…
doSomeWork<std::vector<int>>(10, 20);
```

If doSomeWork uses parentheses when creating localObject, the result is a
std::vector with 10 elements. If doSomeWork uses braces, the result is a std::vec
tor with 2 elements. Which is correct? The author of doSomeWork can’t know. Only
the caller can.

## Item 8: prefer nullptr to 0 and NULL

#### TLDR

- Prefer `nullptr` to 0 and NULL.
- Avoid overloading on integral and pointer types.

`nullptr`'s type is `std::nullptr_t`, which implicitly converts to all raw pointer types.

```c++
f(nullptr); // calls f(void*) overload
```

## Item 9: Prefer alias declarations to typedefs

#### TLDR

- alias declarations maybe templatized while `typedef`s cannot.
- Alias templates avoid the "::type" suffix and, in templates, the "typename" prefix often required to refer to typedefs.

## Item 10: Prefer scoped enums to unscoped enums

#### TLDR

- C++98-style enums are now known as unscoped enums.
- Enumerators of scoped enums are visible only within the enum. They convert to other types only with a cast.
- Both scoped and unscoped enums support specification of the underlying type. The default underlying type for scoped enums is int. Unscoped enums have no default underlying type.
- Scoped enums may always be forward-declared. Unscoped enums may be forward-declared only if their declaration specifies an underlying type.

Scoped enums:

```c++
enum class Color { black, white, red }; // black, white, red are scoped to Color
auto white = false; // fine, no other `white` in scope
Color c = white; // err! no enum named `white` is in this scope
Color c = Color::white; //fine
auto c = Color::white; // fine
```

Advs:

- enumerators are mush more strongly typed. Enumerators for unscoped enums implicitly convert to integral types (and, from there, to floating-point types)
- their names may be forward-declared(Ex: `enum class Color;`), and changing the definition of the enum class(Ex: add a new child) requires no recompilation.

```c++
enum class Status; //underlying type is int
enum class Status: std::uint32_t; // underlying type is std::uint32_t(from <cstdint)
```

Unscoped enums:

```c++
enum Color { black, white, red }; // black, white, red are in same scope as Color
auto white = false; // err! whilte already decleared in this scope
```
